      <p>It began not with a curse, but with a diagram. The High Arithmetician, Vaelin, found it etched into the marrow of a dragon's fossilized spine deep within the Sunless Mines. It was a shape that defied the euclidean laws of our soft, rounded world—a recursive impossibility that hurt the eye just to look upon, like staring into a broken sun.</p>
      
      <p>He called it the "Splintered Angle."</p>
      
      <p>I served Vaelin tea the morning he solved the final equation. He didn't look at me. He was staring at his own hand, or what used to be his hand. The fingers were no longer fingers. They were... crystalline. Not turned to crystal, but rearranged. The flesh had split open, revealing bone that had snapped and reset into a jagged, recursive pattern. His index finger branched into three smaller fingers, which branched again into nine, infinitely smaller, disappearing into a microscopic fuzz of flesh-math that vibrated with a sound like tearing paper.</p>
      
      <p>"It is perfect," Vaelin whispered. His voice was different. Polyphonic. Like a choir of glass flutes playing in discord, or the sound of tectonic plates grinding together. "The flesh is messy, chaotic, wet. The Angle is order. The Angle is dry."</p>
      
      <p>The sickness spread through the tower by sight alone. To see the Angle was to understand it, and to understand it was to become it. The maids were the first to change. I found them in the laundry room, their torsos twisted into Mobius strips, weeping not tears, but perfect geometrical spheres of mercury. Their screams were not sounds, but frequencies that shattered the windows and made my teeth ache.</p>
      
      <p>I blinded myself that night. It was the only way. I took the silver letter opener from Vaelin's desk. It was dull. I had to push hard. The pop was wet and sickening, but the darkness... the darkness was safety. Darkness is unstructured. But I can still hear them. The click-clack of their tessellated feet on the stone. They are building a cathedral of bone and gristle, a monument to the Great Equation.</p>
      
      <p>And sometimes, in the silence, I feel my own ribs itching. Trying to align. I trace the bumps of my spine and count them. <i>One, one-two_three, five, eight...</i> they are following a sequence I do not know, but my body remembers. My bones are doing math in the dark.</p>

      <p>The St. Jude’s Orphanage for the Mechanical Foundling towers over the smog-choked streets of London, a monolith of soot and iron that breathes black smoke into a grey sky. The Matron says we are lucky to be here. She says flesh is weak, rotting, and temporary, but brass is eternal. She says pain is just the body asking for an upgrade.</p>
      
      <p>I watched little Timmy go into the "Adjustment Room" yesterday. He was screaming, dragging his heels on the floorboards, leaving wet trails of tears. The Matron merely smiled, her teeth clicking like ceramic tiles against a metal spoon. When he came out hours later, he didn't cry. He didn't blink. His left leg was gone, replaced by a beautiful, shiny piston that hissed with scalding steam when he walked. The skin where the metal met the thigh was angry and red, stitched with copper wire. He walked with a perfect rhythm now. <i>Clank, hiss. Clank, hiss.</i></p>
      
      <p>They take us one by one. I am hiding in the coal chute now, covered in dust, but I can hear the grinding below. It never stops. The grinding and the ticking. The furnace that smells of burning hair, rancid oil, and seared meat.</p>
      
      <p>Yesterday, at supper, I found a finger in the gruel. It wasn't human. It was porcelain, detailed with terrifying realism—the fingernail painted a soft pink—but with a small copper spring sticking out of the severed knuckle. It twitched on my spoon, tapping against the metal rim. <i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i></p>
      
      <p>The Matron is looking for me. Her eyes replace the candlelight with the glow of the furnace. "Come out, child," she calls. Her voice sounds like grinding gears crushing gravel. "We have a new heart for you. A heart that will never break. A heart that ticks in perfect time. You will never feel cold again. You will never feel <i>anything</i> again."</p>
      
      <p>I look at my own hands. They are trembling. But under the skin of my wrist... is that a pulse? or is it a tick? I press my thumb to the vein. It’s hard. Rigid. And it’s counting down.</p>

      <p>The spore count is 40,000ppm. The air in containment lab 4B is thick, yellow, and smells of old library books, wet dog, and something sweet—like a bowl of fruit left in the sun for a week. The sweetness is the worst part. It coats the back of your tongue like a syrup.</p>
      
      <p>Sample 89-B, discovered in the Marianas Trench, spoke to me today. It didn't use sound. It used the haptics of my containment suit. It vibrated the polymers against my skin in a complex, rhythmic pattern. Morse code? No. Braille? No. It was direct neural induction. It bypassed the ears and whispered straight into the stem of my brain, damp and heavy.</p>
      
      <p><i>"You regret the cat,"</i> it said. <i>"When you were seven. The river. The bag. You held it under until the bubbles stopped. You liked the way the water calmed."</i></p>
      
      <p>I froze. The condensation on my visor turned cold. No one knows about the kitten. It was an accident. I slipped. I was a child. Wasn't I?</p>
      
      <p><i>"We digested the kitten,"</i> the fungus hummed in my mind, a sensation like warm oil pouring over my cortex. <i>"It tasted of milk and terror. We are digesting you now, Aris. We have been since you walked in. Look at your hand."</i></p>
      
      <p>I looked. Through the heavy glove using the x-ray scope. My phalanges were not white. They were porous. Replaced. The marrow had been scooped out and filled with hyphae. The bone was gone, replaced by soft, white webbing. I am walking. I am talking. But I am not me. I am a vehicle. A meat-suit for the colony.</p>
      
      <p><i>"We have replaced the flora in your gut,"</i> it continued. <i>"We are the flora. We are thinking with your stomach. We are hungry, Aris. Go outside. Go deep into the city. Use the subway. Cough."</i></p>
      
      <p>I feel a tickle in my throat. A soft, fuzzy lump rising. I open my mouth to scream, but only a cloud of yellow dust comes out. It’s beautiful in the light. I think I'm going to...</p>
      <p>I'm going to save you all.</p>

      <p>Happy New Year. The party is over, but the air in the apartment feels thick, like it’s been replaced by something heavier than oxygen. The guests didn’t just leave; they evaporated, leaving behind soggy confetti that looks like strips of peeled skin and champagne that smells less like fruit and more like a copper-tinged rot.</p>
      
      <p>The TV is the only thing left alive. I tried to kill it. The remote was slick with a substance I didn't recognize, and when I pressed the power button on the set itself, it gave way with a wet, biological crunch—the sound of a beetle being crushed under a boot. I panicked. I grabbed the cord and yanked it so hard the outlet sparked, scorching the wallpaper. The cord sits on the carpet now, a dead, rubber snake.</p>
      
      <p>The static remains.</p>
      
      <p>It isn't just a flickering screen anymore; it’s a physical presence. The sound has evolved. It’s no longer white noise; it’s a rhythmic, wet clicking, like a billion starving insects stripping the meat from a carcass in perfect unison.</p>
      
      <p>And then, there’s the face.</p>
      
      <p>It is me, but the anatomy is a crime. It’s me turned inside out, a raw, glistening landscape of muscle and exposed nerve endings. The lips have been pulled back over the skull, leaving the teeth to chatter in the open air with a frantic, porcelain clatter. The eyes don't look at me. They are rolled backward, buried deep in the sockets, peering into the dark, hollow vacuum of the skull as if searching for a thought that isn't there.</p>
      
      <p>I leaned in, drawn by a gravity I couldn't fight. I pressed my cheek against the glass. It didn't feel like plastic or glass; it felt like frozen skin. Static electricity danced across my face, not as sparks, but as tiny, invisible needles stitching my pores shut.</p>
      
      <p>The mouth on the screen moved. It didn't use air to speak; it used the noise.</p>
      
      <p>"Let me out," the signal hissed, the voice vibrating in my own marrow. "It’s cold in the broadcast. It’s so empty in the resolution."</p>
      
      <p>The room began to fail. I looked at the corners of the ceiling, but they weren't dark anymore—they were missing. The architecture was breaking down into jagged, grey cubes of noise. The couch didn't dissolve; it unspooled, turning into flat, two-dimensional ribbons of static that drifted toward the ceiling.</p>
      
      <p>I looked at my hand. My fingernails were flickering. The skin was losing its pigment, replaced by a jittering, high-contrast grey. I tried to scream, but the sound that came out was a burst of electronic feedback.</p>
      
      <p>The cold is absolute now. It’s a digital frost that freezes the blood in its tracks. I reached for the screen one last time, a final plea for reality, but there was no resistance. My hand slipped through the glass like it was passing through a veil of cold smoke.</p>
      
      <p>The apartment is gone. The New Year is gone. There is only the hum, the clicking of the insects, and the terrifying realization that I am no longer the viewer. I am the data.</p>
      
      <p>I am the dead channel.</p>

      <p>It began not with a curse, but with a diagram. The High Arithmetician, Vaelin, found it etched into the marrow of a dragon's fossilized spine deep within the Sunless Mines. It was a shape that defied the euclidean laws of our soft, rounded world—a recursive impossibility that caused the optic nerve to throb and weep blood just to look upon.</p>
      
      <p>He called it the "Splintered Angle."</p>
      
      <p>I served Vaelin tea the morning he solved the final equation. He didn't look at me. He was staring at his own hand, or what used to be his hand. The fingers were no longer fingers. They were... crystalline, but not stone. They were rearranged flesh. The joints had snapped and reset into jagged, recursive patterns. His index finger branched into three smaller fingers, which branched again into nine, infinitely smaller, disappearing into a microscopic, vibrating fuzz of meat-math that hummed with a low, agonizing frequency.</p>
      
      <p>"It is perfect," Vaelin whispered. His voice was no longer human. It was polyphonic, a choir of glass flutes playing in discordance inside his throat. "The flesh is messy, chaotic. The Angle is the only truth."</p>
      
      <p>The sickness spread through the tower by sight alone. To see the Angle was to understand it, and to understand it was to host it. I found the maids in the laundry room; their torsos had been twisted into impossible Mobius strips, their internal organs visible and rearranged into precise, repeating triangles. They were weeping not tears, but perfect geometrical spheres of mercury that sizzled on the floor. Their screams were not sounds, but resonant frequencies that shattered the very stone of the walls.</p>
      
      <p>I blinded myself that night. It was the only way to stop the logic from taking root. I took the silver letter opener from Vaelin's desk and... well. Darkness is safety. Darkness is unstructured. But I can still hear them. The rhythmic *click-clack* of their tessellated feet on the stone, like a billion knitting needles. They are building a cathedral of bone and gristle, a monument to the Great Equation, and the air smells of ozone and flayed skin.</p>
      
      <p>And sometimes, in the silence, I feel my own ribs itching. They are shifting, snapping, trying to align. I trace the bumps of my spine and count them. <i>One, one-two-three, five, eight, thirteen...</i> they are following a sequence I do not want to know, but my marrow is already singing the answer.</p>

      <p>The St. Jude’s Orphanage for the Mechanical Foundling towers over the smog-choked streets of London, a monolith of soot, iron, and the muffled screams of the "unoptimized." The Matron says we are lucky. She says flesh is a wet, rotting mistake—a temporary cage—but brass is eternal.</p>
      
      <p>I watched little Timmy go into the "Adjustment Room" yesterday. He was crying because he scraped his knee on the cobblestones. The Matron merely smiled, her teeth clicking like ceramic tiles in a windstorm. When he came out hours later, he didn't cry. He didn't even breathe. His knee was gone, replaced by a beautiful, shiny piston that hissed with scalding steam. But it wasn't just his knee. His eyes were brass orbs that spun independently, and his skin had been stretched so tight over a metal frame that it looked like translucent parchment.</p>
      
      <p>They take us one by one. I am hiding in the coal chute now, the dust clogging my lungs, but I can hear the grinding below. It is the sound of the Great Furnace, a belly of fire that smells of burning hair, rancid oil, and the copper tang of discarded blood. It never stops hungry.</p>
      
      <p>Yesterday, at supper, I found a finger in the gruel. It wasn't human. It was porcelain, detailed with terrifying realism, with a small copper spring sticking out of the severed knuckle. It twitched on my spoon, trying to find a hand to return to. When I looked up, I saw the Matron watching me, her throat clicking as she swallowed something heavy and metallic.</p>
      
      <p>"Come out, child," she calls, her voice the sound of grinding gears crushing gravel. "We have a new heart for you. A heart that will never break, never ache, never flutter. A heart that ticks in perfect time with the factory. You will never feel the cold again, because you will have no nerves to feel it with."</p>
      
      <p>I look at my own hands. They are trembling, but there is a strange, rhythmic pressure building behind my ribs. It isn't a pulse. It’s a winding sensation. <i>Tick. Tick. Tick.</i></p>

      <p>The spore count is 40,000ppm. The air in containment lab 4B is thick, yellow, and tastes of old library books, wet dog, and something sickeningly sweet—like peaches left to liquefy in the sun.</p>
      
      <p>Sample 89-B, discovered in a hydrothermal vent in the Marianas Trench, spoke to me today. It didn't use sound. It used the haptics of my containment suit, vibrating the polymers against my skin in a complex, rhythmic pulse that bypassed my ears and whispered straight into the base of my brain.</p>
      
      <p><i>"You regret the cat,"</i> it hummed, a sensation like warm oil pouring over my cortex. <i>"When you were seven. The river. The bag. You watched the bubbles stop, Aris. You liked the silence."</i></p>
      
      <p>I froze. The condensation on my visor turned to ice. No one knows about the kitten. It was thirty years ago. I’ve buried it under a lifetime of logic and medicine.</p>
      
      <p><i>"Nothing is buried in the soil,"</i> the fungus vibrated, its yellow hyphae pressing against the reinforced glass of the tank. <i>"We digested the kitten. It tasted of milk and terror. We are digesting you now, Aris. We have been since you first breached the seal. Look at your hand. Really look."</i></p>
      
      <p>I activated the x-ray scope on my glove. My phalanges were no longer white bone. They were porous, honeycombed structures, the marrow scooped out and replaced by a thrumming network of fungal thread. I wasn't moving my fingers; the hyphae were pulling them like strings on a puppet.</p>
      
      <p><i>"We have replaced the flora in your gut,"</i> it continued, the voice now sounding like my own mother's. <i>"We are thinking with your stomach now. We are so very hungry, Aris. You are a good vehicle, but you are too small. Go outside. Go into the subway. Go where the air is shared. And when you are in the center of the crowd... breathe out."</i></p>
      
      <p>I feel a tickle in my throat, deep and itchy, like a thousand tiny legs scrambling for the light. I think I'm going to... I think I'm going to open the door.</p>

      <p>Happy New Year. The party is over, but the air in the apartment feels thick, like it’s been replaced by something heavier than oxygen. The guests didn’t just leave; they evaporated, leaving behind soggy confetti that looks like strips of peeled skin and champagne that smells less like fruit and more like a copper-tinged rot.</p>
      
      <p>The TV is the only thing left alive. I tried to kill it. The remote was slick with a substance I didn't recognize, and when I pressed the power button on the set itself, it gave way with a wet, biological crunch—the sound of a beetle being crushed under a boot. I panicked. I grabbed the cord and yanked it so hard the outlet sparked, scorching the wallpaper. The cord sits on the carpet now, a dead, rubber snake.</p>
      
      <p>The static remains.</p>
      
      <p>It isn't just a flickering screen anymore; it’s a physical presence. The sound has evolved. It’s no longer white noise; it’s a rhythmic, wet clicking, like a billion starving insects stripping the meat from a carcass in perfect unison.</p>
      
      <p>And then, there’s the face.</p>
      
      <p>It is me, but the anatomy is a crime. It’s me turned inside out, a raw, glistening landscape of muscle and exposed nerve endings. The lips have been pulled back over the skull, leaving the teeth to chatter in the open air with a frantic, porcelain clatter. The eyes don't look at me. They are rolled backward, buried deep in the sockets, peering into the dark, hollow vacuum of the skull as if searching for a thought that isn't there.</p>
      
      <p>I leaned in, drawn by a gravity I couldn't fight. I pressed my cheek against the glass. It didn't feel like plastic or glass; it felt like frozen skin. Static electricity danced across my face, not as sparks, but as tiny, invisible needles stitching my pores shut.</p>
      
      <p>The mouth on the screen moved. It didn't use air to speak; it used the noise.</p>
      
      <p>"Let me out," the signal hissed, the voice vibrating in my own marrow. "It’s cold in the broadcast. It’s so empty in the resolution."</p>
      
      <p>The room began to fail. I looked at the corners of the ceiling, but they weren't dark anymore—they were missing. The architecture was breaking down into jagged, grey cubes of noise. The couch didn't dissolve; it unspooled, turning into flat, two-dimensional ribbons of static that drifted toward the ceiling.</p>
      
      <p>I looked at my hand. My fingernails were flickering. The skin was losing its pigment, replaced by a jittering, high-contrast grey. I tried to scream, but the sound that came out was a burst of electronic feedback.</p>
      
      <p>The cold is absolute now. It’s a digital frost that freezes the blood in its tracks. I reached for the screen one last time, a final plea for reality, but there was no resistance. My hand slipped through the glass like it was passing through a veil of cold smoke.</p>
      
      <p>The apartment is gone. The New Year is gone. There is only the hum, the clicking of the insects, and the terrifying realization that I am no longer the viewer. I am the data.</p>
      
      <p>I am the dead channel.</p>

      <p>I don't know how long I've been walking. Time doesn't work here. My watch stopped three days ago—or maybe three years ago—at 4:02 PM. The only constant is the Hum. That buzzing, insect-like drone of the fluorescent lights. It’s loud enough to feel in your teeth, a constant vibration that scrapes against your sanity.</p>
      
      <p>The smell is the worst part. It smells like wet carpet. Not fresh water, but stagnant, moldy water that has been trapped under synthetic fibers for a decade. It’s humid, clammy, and warm. Like the breath of a sickly animal.</p>
      
      <p>The walls are mono-yellow. A sickly, jaundice yellow that seems to pulse if you stare at it too long. There are no windows. No doors to the outside. Just endless, randomly segmented rooms. I’ve walked for miles in a straight line and ended up back where I started, or what looks like where I started. Every room is the same, but wrong. The outlets are in different places. The wallpaper patterns don't line up.</p>
      
      <p>Yesterday, I found a room with a chair in the center. A simple, wooden chair. I sat down to rest, and the chair felt... soft. Warm. Like flesh. I stood up and saw a bruise forming on the wood where I had touched it.</p>
      
      <p>And now, I hear it. Heavy, wet footsteps. Slapping against the moist carpet. They aren't coming from behind me. They're coming from the walls. I put my ear to the wallpaper. I heard breathing. Slow, ragged breathing on the other side of the plaster.</p>
      
      <p>The lights just flickered. They stayed off for a full second this time. When they came back on, the hallway had changed. It’s longer now. And at the very end... something is standing there. It has no face. Just a smooth patch of skin where eyes should be. And it's waving at me.</p>

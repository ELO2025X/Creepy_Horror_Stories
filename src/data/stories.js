      <p>It began not with a curse, but with a diagram. The High Arithmetician, Vaelin, found it etched into the marrow of a dragon's fossilized spine deep within the Sunless Mines. It was a shape that defied the euclidean laws of our soft, rounded world—a recursive impossibility that hurt the eye just to look upon.</p>
      
      <p>He called it the "Splintered Angle."</p>
      
      <p>I served Vaelin tea the morning he solved the final equation. He didn't look at me. He was staring at his own hand, or what used to be his hand. The fingers were no longer fingers. They were... crystalline. Not turned to crystal, but rearranged. The joints had snapped and reset into a jagged, recursive pattern. His index finger branched into three smaller fingers, which branched again into nine, infinitely smaller, disappearing into a microscopic fuzz of flesh-math.</p>
      
      <p>"It is perfect," Vaelin whispered. His voice was different. Polyphonic. Like a choir of glass flutes playing in discord. "The flesh is messy, chaotic. The Angle is order."</p>
      
      <p>The sickness spread through the tower by sight alone. To see the Angle was to understand it, and to understand it was to become it. The maids were the first to change. I found them in the laundry room, their torsos twisted into Mobius strips, weeping not tears, but perfect geometrical spheres of mercury. Their screams were not sounds, but frequencies that shattered the windows.</p>
      
      <p>I blinded myself that night. It was the only way. I took the silver letter opener from Vaelin's desk and... well. Darkness is safety. Darkness is unstructured. But I can still hear them. The click-clack of their tessellated feet on the stone. They are building a cathedral of bone and gristle, a monument to the Great Equation.</p>
      
      <p>And sometimes, in the silence, I feel my own ribs itching. Trying to align. I trace the bumps of my spine and count them. <i>One, one-two_three, five, eight...</i> they are following a sequence I do not know, but my body remembers.</p>

      <p>The St. Jude’s Orphanage for the Mechanical Foundling towers over the smog-choked streets of London, a monolith of soot and iron. The Matron says we are lucky to be here. She says flesh is weak, rotting, and temporary, but brass is eternal.</p>
      
      <p>I watched little Timmy go into the "Adjustment Room" yesterday. He was crying because he scraped his knee on the cobblestones. The Matron merely smiled, her teeth clicking like ceramic tiles. When he came out hours later, he didn't cry. He didn't blink. His knee was gone, replaced by a beautiful, shiny piston that hissed with steam when he walked. He walked with a perfect rhythm now. <i>Clank, hiss. Clank, hiss.</i></p>
      
      <p>They take us one by one. I am hiding in the coal chute now, covered in dust, but I can hear the grinding below. It never stops. The grinding and the ticking. The furnace that smells of burning hair and oil.</p>
      
      <p>Yesterday, at supper, I found a finger in the gruel. It wasn't human. It was porcelain, detailed with terrifying realism, with a small copper spring sticking out of the severed knuckle. It twitched on my spoon.</p>
      
      <p>The Matron is looking for me. Her eyes replace the candlelight with the glow of the furnace. "Come out, child," she calls. Her voice sounds like grinding gears crushing gravel. "We have a new heart for you. A heart that will never break. A heart that ticks in perfect time. You will never feel cold again."</p>
      
      <p>I look at my own hands. They are trembling. But under the skin of my wrist... is that a pulse? or is it a tick?</p>

      <p>The spore count is 40,000ppm. The air in containment lab 4B is thick, yellow, and smells of old library books, wet dog, and something sweet—like rotting fruit.</p>
      
      <p>Sample 89-B, discovered in the Marianas Trench, spoke to me today. It didn't use sound. It used the haptics of my containment suit. It vibrated the polymers against my skin in a complex, rhythmic pattern. Morse code? No. Braille? No. It was direct neural induction. It bypassed the ears and whispered straight into the stem of my brain.</p>
      
      <p><i>"You regret the cat,"</i> it said. <i>"When you were seven. The river. The bag."</i></p>
      
      <p>I froze. The condensation on my visor turned cold. No one knows about the kitten. It was an accident. I slipped. I was a child.</p>
      
      <p><i>"We digested the kitten,"</i> the fungus hummed in my mind, a sensation like warm oil pouring over my cortex. <i>"It tasted of milk and terror. We are digesting you now, Aris. We have been since you walked in. Look at your hand."</i></p>
      
      <p>I looked. Through the heavy glove using the x-ray scope. My phalanges were not white. They were porous. Replaced. The marrow had been scooped out and filled with hyphae. I am walking. I am talking. But I am not me. I am a vehicle.</p>
      
      <p><i>"We have replaced the flora in your gut,"</i> it continued. <i>"We are the flora. We are thinking with your stomach. We are hungry, Aris. Go outside. Go deep into the city. Cough."</i></p>
      
      <p>I feel a tickle in my throat. I think I'm going to... I'm going to...</p>

      <p>Happy New Year. The party is over. The guests have left. The confetti is soggy with spilled champagne and the apartment smells of stale smoke.</p>
      
      <p>I tried to turn off the TV. The remote isn't working. The power button on the set is stuck, depresses with a wet crunch. I pulled the plug. I literally pulled the plug out of the wall, sparking the outlet. The cord hangs loose on the carpet.</p>
      
      <p>The static remains. It's getting louder. A white noise that sounds less like rain and more like a billion insects chewing on dry leaves. And there's a face in the snow. Not a human face. It looks like... me. But inside out. The teeth are on the outside of the lips, chattering. The eyes are looking inward, inspecting the hollow skull.</p>
      
      <p>It's mouthing something. I pressed my ear to the glass, feeling the static electricity prickle my skin like cold needles. The static hisses, <i>"Let me out. It's cold in here. It's so cold in the signal."</i></p>
      
      <p>The room is changing. The corners of the ceiling are pixelating. The couch is dissolving into grey noise. I look at my hand—it's fuzzy at the edges, losing resolution.</p>
      
      <p>I'm feeling cold too. I think... I think I'm on the wrong side of the screen. I reach for the glass, but my hand passes through. I am the broadcast now.</p>
